# Copenhagen Work Cafes

Is a site template that helps users find cafes where they are able to work and find whatever they need. 
The site has the functionality of filtering based on some criteria.
Allows users to add and delete websites.

NOTE: The Project is not yet finished and requires some additional functionality. Currently part of an assignment and future improvements will include:

1. Admin and user functionality that will allow only admins to delete cafes. Users will be able to still post new cafe's, if they do not exist
2. An embeded google map converter. Currently each entry has to be entered using the correct code (embeded map), or the tiny map in the list of cafes and in the cafe descriptions will absolutelly not work. I read online that you are able to make a converter, that can take a much shorter googlemaps route. But so far it has not worked.
3. More API functionality. I would like the project to be able to send out aggregate data about the cafe's in question to anyone who needs it. For now it just returns a json with all of the cafes
4. Would need an implementation of PostgeSQL, for now uses a SQLAlchemy integration, which might require you to create an isntance folder
5. Adding a contact page, mostly when it is ready for launch

Here are some pictures of how it looks and works:
